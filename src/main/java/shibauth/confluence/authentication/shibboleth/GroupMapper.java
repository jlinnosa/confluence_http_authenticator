/**
 * GroupMapper is capable to process an incoming value(s) and
 * producing the output desired as specified by the mapping regex.
 * The properties that can be specified in this class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>match = the regex to which the incoming header to be matched</li>
 * <li>transform = the regex that is responsible to produce the expected output
 * once "match" is successful</li>
 * <li>casesensitive= boolean value whether to be sensitive about matching
 * the input. default is true</li>
 * <li>retract = boolean value whether this mapping should remove a particular
 * group from user. default is false</li>
 * <li>force = boolean value to decide whether this mapper will override any
 * other mappers' result (with respect to the same group). default is false</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The processing logic is as follow:
 * <ol>
 * <li>an input such as "urn:abc:xyz" which represents a group is evaluated</li>
 * <li>supposed match regex = urn\:(abc)\:(.*)</li>
 * <li>supposed transform = $1_$2</li>
 * <li>initially the groupmapper will check whether the input satisfies
 * its 'match' regex, if so then this mapper is activated</li>
 * <li>it then check whether a specific transform is defined, if so
 * the transform is executed (if it is not explicitly defined, the output
 * will be exactly whatever the outcome of match regex which is the same as
 * the input</li>
 * <li>if retract is set to true, then this mapper will perform reversal of
 * previously made mapping (e.g. it will remove the user from confluence's
 * group matching the output rather than adding the user to the group;
 * purging the roles). This only <strong>happens</strong> when there
 * is <strong>no</strong> other mappers explicitly requiring the user
 * to be added to the group (e.g. allow-overide combining algorithm)
 * and none other mappers that process the same output has explicitly
 * specify its "force" attribute to be true.</li>
 * <li>if force is true, then the outcome of this mapper takes precedence</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * Two or more mappers that produce the same output (group) and have their "force"
 * attribute specified to be true will have undefined result (1 of these
 * mappers will win, but dont know which one ;)
 * <p/>
 * This mapper, when placed in sorted list, will be placed at the back of the
 * list if its 'force' attribute is set to true.
